This book is all about Graphs & Equations, it will give you a basic idea about how equations work and how to manipulate them to get desired shape. I have worked my best to bring all the methods and techniques I have used for graphing together. Whether you're a seasoned professional looking to expand your knowledge or a beginner just starting out, I believe this book has something for everyone.

Note : This is the updated version to Grapher's Guide To Graphing ([https://thegrapher.gumroad.com/l/Ebook](https://thegrapher.gumroad.com/l/Ebook)), you don't need to buy that if you bought this.
