Open the black box of machine learning.
---------------------------------------

Jumping into machine learning has never been easier. But libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch hide the complexities from you. Looking under the hood is a **superpower**, and machine learning is written in the language of linear algebra.

**This book is the best way to learn it.**
