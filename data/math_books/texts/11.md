Do you feel like you’re drowning in data? If you do, it’s of utmost importance to learn how to swim and navigate through this vast space. Today, data is the most expensive product that you can find online. Every time you accept cookies on a website, you’ve given the internet a small portion of yourself that will be used to train and enhance already-existing but also future analytical and AI systems.

“My data is useless,” you’ll say, “Who wants to learn about my coffee maker preferences, Nespresso or Dolce Gusto, nobody cares.”

Your personal data may not matter to an individual entity within some data organization. After all, you’re just a row or a JSON entry in some super-large database, lake or a warehouse. But that one row can be a deciding factor for the performance of an artificial intelligence system.

Do you feel confused by all these terms but want to get into it?

Great! Because I created a detailed and comprehensive data analysis roadmap with all the tools and resources you can learn to kickstart your career in data.

Whether you are a beginner who needs a direction to find a job or data, or start your own data consulting agency, this roadmap will guide you along the path to mastery of this innovative field.
