Math is a powerful tool for modelling the world around us. Mathematical methods are the foundation of science, engineering, design, and many other fields. Unfortunately, many people feel uncomfortable with math and try to avoid it.

This book provides a concise introduction to the fundamental ideas of math and highlights the connections between topics. The conversational tone of the writing will help readers overcome their and connect with the subject. Each section in this book is a short tutorial that covers one math topic with clear definitions, illustrative examples and concise explanations.

The exercises and problem sets will help readers practice what they've learned. **This book is an efficient way for adults to (re)discover fundamental math ideas** and for students to prepare for university-level courses. Math modelling skills are accessible to all readers, regardless of their mathematical background.

#### FAQs:

**Q1**: What is the difference between this book and the more expensive [No Bullshit Guide to Math and Physics](https://gum.co/noBSmathphys)?

**A1**: The Math & Physics book includes all the material from this book as well as chapters on mechanics (motion, forces, energy, etc.) and calculus (limits, derivatives, integrals, etc.). If you're also interested in learning these more advanced topics, you should get the big book instead of this one. It is highly praised and recommended among science and engineering students.
