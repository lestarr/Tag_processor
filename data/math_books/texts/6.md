Improve your skills by learning math for data science and machine learning using code and visualizations.

The great libraries in the data science and machine learning ecosystem allow you to dive into the field without knowing much about the theory. I think that this top-down approach is a great way to start: take real data and run some algorithms.

Then, a lot of questions arise like: "Why don't I get the expected prediction performance on this dataset?", "How can I adapt this algorithm to my specific use case?" At this point, the lack of theory can be a limit to your skill growth. The solution is to dive a bit more into the theory and sharpen your understanding.

In this book, I'll introduce you to math concepts specifically targeted at increasing your understanding in data science and machine learning. I can assure you that even a preliminary exposition to math thinking will clear your vision of the field.

Because the audience of this book is people without a deep math background (e.g. junior data scientists, developers in a career move to data science), the approach is: no-jargon and more insights. You'll just need high school math notions (even rusted).

A preliminary exposition to Python (ideally with the library Numpy) is something that will allow you to make the most of this book. The level of programming skill needed is a bit higher in the hands-on projects at the end of each chapter.
