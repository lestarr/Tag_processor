If you do, it’s of utmost importance to learn how to swim and navigate through this vast space. Today, data is the most expensive product that you can find online. Every time you accept cookies on a website, you’ve given the internet a small portion of yourself that will be used to train and enhance already-existing but also future analytical and AI systems.\\n\\n“My data is useless,” you’ll say, “Who wants to learn about my coffee maker preferences, Nespresso or Dolce Gusto, nobody cares.”\\n\\nYour personal data may not matter to an individual entity within some data organization. After all, you’re just a row or a JSON entry in some super-large database, lake or a warehouse. But that one row can be a deciding factor for the performance of an artificial intelligence system.\\n\\nDo you feel confused by all these terms but want to get into it?\\n\\nGreat!
